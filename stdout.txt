The eight of cups reveals a time of restlessness when it feels as if something is missing. Work and relationshipships may appear harmonious from the outside, but your intuition is nagging you
future: The tarot card you pulled, the upright Fool, signifies new beginnings and following your heart's desire, even though the journey ahead is not without danger.

The Fool brings an opportunity to start over or feel young again or excited at the prospect of a new way of living
